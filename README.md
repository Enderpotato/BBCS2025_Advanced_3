## About

This is a app that is targeted at students with ADHD who get distracted easily and helps them to pay attention with friendly audio reminders.

This app uses real time Object Detection to detect if the person sitting infront is distracted. Works well 0.5-1m away from camera and only with 1 person.

We used a pretrained object detection [model](https://universe.roboflow.com/neurosense/user-attention/model/1)
