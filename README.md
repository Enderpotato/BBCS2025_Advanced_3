# BBCSJune2025

We used a pretrained object detection [model](https://universe.roboflow.com/neurosense/user-attention/model/1)

to run main.py, you need to do pip install requirements.txt (not tested btw but you can figure it out)
the cwd must in the app folder or else the path will be wrong

app will run in localhost port 5000
